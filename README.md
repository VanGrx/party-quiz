# Party Quiz
Quiz that can easily connect people in the room and help them have fun!

## Idea

This project is meant for house or any other party location with a big screen for the scoreboard and a lot of people with phones ready to test their knowledge.

## Usage

### Step 1
The application can run on any machine with local network. For now, you must give IP address and port with the directory of the 'pages' files.

### Step 2
Open you favorite browser and go to your ip_address:port, select 'scoreboard page', choose number of people that will play and wait for people to join

### Step 3
Open web browser on your phone and go to the same ip_address:port and select 'player page'. Type your name and game number and prepare for the game. The game will start as soon as the player number is filled.

### Step 4
Have fun!

## Goal

This project is created as a part of the Boost Beast library exploration and a game to play with my wife when Sporcle becomes too repetative.

## Future

The features that I would like to add:

- [ ] Android app for the players
- [ ] Global server endpoint so people can only click to create game and generate game code
- [ ] TOTAL MAKEOVER OF THE UI!
- [ ] More game modes

If by some crazy luck, you would like to contribute, or use this code - feel free to share the experience or create a pull request.
